## Direct, unsafe Rust bindings for Linux's `perf_event_open` system call

This crate exports `unsafe` Rust wrappers for Linux system calls for accessing
performance monitoring counters and tracing facilities. This includes:

- the processor's own performance monitoring registers
- kernel counters for things like context switches and page faults
- kernel tracepoints, kprobe, and uprobes
- processor tracing facilities like Intel's Branch Trace Store (BTS)
- hardware breakpoints

This crate provides:

- a Rust wrapper the Linux `perf_event_open` system call
- Rust wrappers for the ioctls you can apply to a file descriptor returned by `perf_event_open`
- bindings for `perf_event_open`'s associated header files, automatically generated by `bindgen`

All functions are direct, `unsafe` wrappers for the underlying calls. They
operate on raw pointers and raw file descriptors.

For a type-safe API for basic functionality, see the [perf-event] crate.
